# bio-anno-rs

A collection of utilities for reading, writing, and handling records
contained in file formats commonly-used in bioinformatics.

This is very unstable code and should be expected to change
without warning.

## TODO:

* Handle more data types.
* Use traits to simplify code for common operations, such as filtering records in a narrowpeak, bedgraph, gff, etc., file.
